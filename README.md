## Dataset Description

During this weekâ€™s Independent project, you will get to test the skills that you learned this week. More specifically, you will get the test your understanding of the following learning outcomes.

Overall Learning Outcomes

I can understand and apply supervised learning algorithms such as regression, decision trees, KNN, SVM, naive Bayes, random forests to solving business problems.
I can understand the benefits, limitations, and requirements of various supervised learning algorithms.

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

### Methods Used
* Descriptive Statistics

```python
import pandas as pd # python library that import datasets into a working env and does so much more such as helping in cleaning datasets etc
import numpy as np # offers comprehensive mathematical functions etc
```

 * Data Preprocessing Methods used

## Needs of this project
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning - involves taking care of missing data, outliers and duplicates before after merging the datasets
- Data Analysis 
- Modelling
